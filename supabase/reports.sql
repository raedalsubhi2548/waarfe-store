-- Raed store — Reports (التقارير): first-party visitor tracking + one admin report function.
-- Run once in Supabase → SQL Editor (after the other files). Safe to run again.

-- 1) Every page view / cart / checkout from the store. Written only by the server (/api/hit, service role);
--    nobody reads it directly — the admin sees it through admin_report below.
